        <h2>Overview of Experience</h2>
        <p>I have worked with State Employees' Credit Union for over three years. My experience there has taught me how to manage my time and how to think outside of the box. There have been several times when I've had to come up with different solutions outside in order to help members in difficult situations. I have also regularly had to manage my time and prioritize in order to complete the different tasks that I've had.</p>
        <p>In terms of my development experience, I have completed multiple projects as you can see on the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page.</p>
